# This file is used to run the container with docker-compose on Jetson Orin Nano (arm64)
# You can run the container with the following command:
# docker compose -f docker-compose.jetson.sensors.yaml -d (to run the container in the background)
# docker compose -f docker-compose.jetson.sensors.yaml exec ros_dev_radar bash (to enter the container)
# docker compose -f docker-compose.jetson.sensors.yaml down (to stop and delete the container)
