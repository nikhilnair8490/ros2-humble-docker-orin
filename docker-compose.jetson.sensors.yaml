# This file is used to run the container with docker-compose on Jetson Orin Nano (arm64)
# You can run the container with the following command:
# docker compose -f docker-compose.jetson.sensors.yaml -d (to run the container in the background)
# docker compose -f docker-compose.jetson.sensors.yaml exec abaja_ros_dev bash (to enter the container)
# docker compose -f docker-compose.jetson.sensors.yaml down (to stop and delete the container)

      #- "/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu:/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu:ro" # (Optional) Mounts essential libraries from the Jetpack system into the container
      #- "/usr/lib/udev:/usr/lib/udev:ro" # (Optional) `udev` is the device manager in Linux. Mounting `/usr/lib/udev` can be necessary for proper device detection and access within the container, especially for hardware like cameras, sensors, and USB devices connected to the Jetson.
      - "/dev:/dev" # (Optional, but often needed) The `/dev` directory contains device files that represent hardware devices. Mounting `/dev` gives the container direct access to these device files e.g CAN bus, serial ports, etc.
